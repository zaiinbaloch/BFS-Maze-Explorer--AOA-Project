**BFS Maze Explorer**

An interactive educational game that visualizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for maze pathfinding. Developed as part of the Analysis of Algorithms course at Riphah International University.

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the Breadth-First Search algorithm through an engaging maze navigation game. Players can either manually navigate through the maze or watch the BFS algorithm find the shortest path automatically. The game provides real-time visualization of visited nodes, queue processing, and path reconstruction.

**Features**

- **Interactive 15×15 Maze**: Pre-designed maze with multiple possible paths
- **Dual Game Modes**: 
  - Manual navigation using arrow keys
  - Automated BFS visualization
- **Real-time Algorithm Visualization**: Watch BFS explore nodes level by level
- **Path Efficiency Analysis**: Compare your path with the optimal BFS solution
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control BFS execution with next-step functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Track steps, efficiency rating, and path comparisons
- **Undo Functionality**: Learn from mistakes with backtracking capability

**Learning Objectives**

- Understand Breadth-First Search algorithm mechanics
- Visualize graph traversal in real-time
- Learn about shortest path finding in unweighted graphs
- Compare algorithm performance with manual problem-solving
- Study time and space complexity through practical implementation

**Installation & Setup**

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6 or higher (I have used python 3.14)
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
